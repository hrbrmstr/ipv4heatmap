Title: Generate Hilbert Curve Heatmaps from IPv4 Address Lists

Description: Hilbert curves (in this case 12th order Hilbert curves) provide a
    compact visual representation of IPv4 class C subnets, keeping addresses of
    neighboring subnets close together. More populated subnets will have
    different colors (or different alpha values), thus creating a 'heatmap'
    effect, providing a means of determining 'hot spots'.

Title: IPv4 Hilbert curve heatmap generator

Description: This package generates IPv4 Hilbert space heatmaps. Given a vector
    of IPv4 addresses, the main function - ipv4heatmap - will return a ggplot
    object and a data frame (data.table) of the IPv4 addresses mapped to a
    4096x4096 Hilbert plane. There are also functions to generate area bounding
    boxes from CIDR blocks which can then be overlaid onto the base Hilbert
    heatmap and for converting vectors of IPv4 addresses from long to character
    (and back).
