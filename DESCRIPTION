Description: Hilbert curves (in this case 12th order Hilbert curves) provide a
    compact visual representation of IPv4 class C subnets, keeping addresses of
    neighboring subnets close together. More populated subnets will have
    different colors (or different alpha values), thus creating a 'heatmap'
    effect, providing a means of determining 'hot spots'.
