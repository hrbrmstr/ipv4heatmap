\title{IPv4 Hilbert Curve Matrix}
\usage{
ipv4matrix(ip)
}
\arguments{
\item{ip}{input character (dotted-deciman IPv4s) vector}
}
\value{
4096x4096 matrix, with non-0 entries being the count of IP addresses in that netblock
}
\description{
Returns a 4096x4096 Hilbert curve matrix for an input vector of IP addresses. Generally not called directly (most of the time you'll want to use \code{ipv4heatmap}), but avilable in the event another method of visualization is necessary/desired.
