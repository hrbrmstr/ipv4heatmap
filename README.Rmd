ipv4heatmap : Generate Hilbert Curve Heatmaps from IPv4 Address Lists

Rcpp-backed package for making Hilbert IPv4 space heatmaps in R. The C/C++ code is heavily based on the work of [The Measurement Factory](http://maps.measurement-factory.com/).

The following functions are implemented:

- `boundingBoxFromCIDR`:	Bounding box from CIDR blocks
- `ip2long`:	Character (dotted-decimal) IPv4 Address Conversion to long integer
- `ipv4heatmap`:	Create an IPv4 Hilbert curve heatmap
- `ipv4matrix`:	IPv4 Hilbert Curve Matrix
- `long2ip`:	Intger IPv4 Address Conversion to Character

### News

- v0.3.0.999 - No longer requires Boost libraries, passes CRAN checks
- v0.2.5 adds the ability to pass a numeric vector instead of a character vector to the main function
- v0.2.0 fixes a bug where the resultant plot might not be 4096x4096 and also removes the last of the ggplot2 border artifacts

### Installation

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/ipv4heatmap")
```

```{r options_2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
options(width=200)
```

### Usage

```{r usage}
library(ipv4heatmap)

# current verison
packageVersion("ipv4heatmap")

(ip2long(c( "105.212.209.72", "115.126.247.136")))

(long2ip(c(1775554888, 1937700744)))

(boundingBoxFromCIDR("30.0.0.0/8"))

# get and plot some IPs from ZeusTracker
loc <- tempfile()
download.file("https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/blocklist.php?download=badips", 
              loc, method="curl")
ips <- grep("^#", readLines(loc), invert=TRUE, value=TRUE)
unlink(loc)

hm <- ipv4heatmap(ips)

hm$gg
```
